## Usage üìñ

Once the server is running, you can interact with the web UI or use the API endpoints.

### Web UI

Access the web interface by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You can input text and generate speech directly from the UI.

### API Endpoints

The server provides several API endpoints for integration into your applications. Here are some key endpoints:

- **Generate Speech**: POST request to `/api/generate` with text data.
- **Clone Voice**: POST request to `/api/clone` with voice samples.
- **Dialogue Generation**: POST request to `/api/dialogue` with conversation context.

## API Endpoints üîó

### Generate Speech

**Endpoint**: `/api/generate`

**Method**: POST

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "text": "Your text here",
  "voice": "selected_voice"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "audio_url": "URL_to_generated_audio"
}
```

### Clone Voice

**Endpoint**: `/api/clone`

**Method**: POST

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "voice_samples": ["sample1.wav", "sample2.wav"]
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "voice_id": "unique_voice_id"
}
```

### Dialogue Generation

**Endpoint**: `/api/dialogue`

**Method**: POST

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "context": "previous conversation context"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "dialogue": "Generated dialogue response"
}
```

## Voice Cloning üó£Ô∏è

Voice cloning allows you to create custom voices based on provided samples. To clone a voice:

1. Collect audio samples of the desired voice.
2. Send a POST request to the `/api/clone` endpoint with the audio files.

The server will process the samples and return a unique voice ID that you can use for generating speech.

## Dialogue Generation üí¨

The dialogue generation feature enables you to create realistic conversations. You can provide a context, and the server will generate responses that fit naturally within that context.

To use this feature:

1. Prepare the conversation context.
2. Send a POST request to the `/api/dialogue` endpoint.

## Execution on GPU/CPU ‚öôÔ∏è

The Dia TTS Server supports execution on both GPU and CPU. You can choose your preferred execution environment by configuring the settings in the `config.py` file.

### GPU Execution

To enable GPU execution, ensure you have the appropriate CUDA drivers installed. The server will automatically detect the GPU and utilize it for processing.

### CPU Execution

If you prefer to run on CPU, simply set the configuration to use CPU. The server will adjust its processing accordingly.
